# Mini Data Analysis 2 Introduction 

This is a repository for the **Mini Data Analysis Milestone 2** for STAT 545 at the University of British Columbia. This repository contains the first Mini Data Analysis Milestone 1, which contains a basic analysis report of the *apt_buildings* dataset as both an Rmd file and an Md file. This now also contains a more in-depth analysis of the *apt_buildings* dataset, in both an Rmd and Md file. 
The original report in the mini-data-analysis-1.Md file includes ggplot2 and dplyr functions that analyze the relationship between the year the apartment building was built, and the overall safety features of the apartment buildings included in the dataset. It includes R markdown features 
The most recent mini-data-analysis-2.Md file includes multiple functions from dplyr, ggplot, forcats, tidyverse, and the datateachr packages. It looks at the accessibility of the apartment buildings in the *apt_buildings* dataset, how that accessibility changes with when the year was built, the number of safety features present or absent in different types of apartment buildings, and to see if there is a relationship between the number of safety features present in the type of property the apartment building is.

To view off of github, clone the repository into your local computer, and open the file as an R markdown file.
